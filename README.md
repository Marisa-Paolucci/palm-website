# Palm-website

This is my final project for Code Kentucky's Web Dev 1 course. It is a website for a fictional plant store named Palm. Per project requirements, it contains HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Flexbox, media queries, and accessible features. 

## Additional Features:
  1. An accessible responsive menu:
      * The mobile menu has aria attributes for the toggle element
      * The navigation can be opened with a keyboard
      * A screen reader can be used for navigation
      * The menu is responsive for mobile, tablet, and desktop

  2. A page speed was ran using pagespeed.web.dev and a score of 95 for mobile and 99 for desktop was    achieved

  3. Per my project plan, I was going to use accessibilitychecker.org to run an accessibility check on my site. Per this accessibility checker, a compliant score of 85 was achieved. However, it listed a number of items that were not applicable to my site. Therefore, I used pagespeed.web.dev and accessibe.com instead. Per pagespeed.web.dev, my site achieved an accessibility score of 98 for mobile and 100 for desktop. Per accessibe.com, my site is listed as WCAG 2.1 level AA compliant. The following is a list of accessibile features added to my site:
      * Accessible navigation with aria attributes
      * Skip to Main button for keyboard users
      * WCAG 2.1 line-spacing, font-size, and line-height
      * Alt descriptions for images
      * Per accessibility checker recommendations, "required" was added to contact form labels, and font/background colors were adjusted using a contrast checker

  4. The following CSS/JavaScript animations/arrays were added:
      * Hover animation on desktop menu
      * Hamburger animation on mobile menu
      * A Skip to Main link for keyboard users that appears when using the tab key and disappears once it  is used
      * Accordions for shop items with color and toggle transitions
      * Contact form shows error messages if fields are left blank
